# CooffeeDan

We ask the user to chhose from three drinks: 1) espresso 2)latte 3)cappuccino
Each of them requires a different quantity of water,
a different quantity of coffee and a different quantity of milk.
And they also each half a different price.
We're going to be modeling all this data in the coffee machine program
We need the coffee machine to be able to print a report.
It needs to be able to tell what resources it has left,
It also asks for coins to be inserted if there's actually not enough money to cover thre drink then it refunds the money. 
But on the other hand, if enough money is inserted,then it should be able to calculate how much money all of these coins are worthand then calculate the amount of change based on the cost of the drink.
